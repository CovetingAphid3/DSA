## Introduction

In this repository, you will find implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms. Each directory is dedicated to a specific data structure or algorithm and contains code written in Javascript. Alongside the code, you will also find explanations, complexities, and use cases to better understand the concepts.

## Data Structures

- [Linked-List](./Data-Structures/Linked-List): Implementation of singly and doubly linked lists.
- [Stack](./Data-Structures/Stack): Implementation of a stack data structure.
- [Queue](./Data-Structures/Queue): Implementation of a queue data structure.
- [Binary-Search-Tree](./Data-Structures/Binary-Search-Tree/): Implementation of binary tree and related algorithms.
- [Heap](./Data-Structures/Heap/)


## Algorithms

- [Recursion](./Algorithms/Recursion/)
- [Sorting](./Algorithms/Sort%20Algorithms/): Implementations of various sorting algorithms (e.g., bubble sort, merge sort, quicksort).
- [Searching](./Algorithms/Search%20Algorithm/): Implementations of different searching algorithms (e.g., binary search, linear search).
- [Dynamic Programming](./DynamicProgramming): Dynamic programming solutions for various problems.
